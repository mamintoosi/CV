abstract = {Today, air pollution in urban areas is a major issue that have been affecting human health and the environment. Over the years artificial neural network methods has been used for prediction of pollutants concentration in many metropolitans. In the present study data were obtained from department of environment and air quality controlling stations in city of Tehran from March 2012 to October 2013. Prediction of CO and PM10 contaminations during cold and warm seasons under the influence of instability indices and meteorological parameters was done using the artificial neural network. Results of the modeling process showed that the highest correlation coefficient was obtained 0.84 for PM10 in warm season. On the contrary, the highest correlation coefficient of CO in cold season was 0.78. Also, the effect of instability indices on air pollution was investigated. The highest CO concentration occurred during cold seasons (R2= 0.81), while the lowest concentration was in warm season (R2= 0.72). In case of  PM, the highest concentration occurred during warm seasons (R2= 0.84), while the lowest concentration was in cold season (R2=0.75).},

abstract="Today, the air pollution is a serious environmental problem becoming global concern for human beings Air quality is influenced by emissions, meteorological parameters and topography. The effect of these parameters can be predicted using statistical methods. In current study, the data in the period of March 2012 to October 2013 are used. These data have been gathered from the stations of the Department of Environment and Air Quality Control Organization (Azadi and Sharif stations) in Tehran city. The main purpose was to predict the air quality of the next day and emissions of carbon monoxide and suspended particles under the influence of instability indices and meteorological parameters using the Artificial Neural Network. Results of modeling process showed that the concentration of pollutants is strongly influenced by meteorological parameters. In addition, prediction of the PM10 concentration of the next day using meteorological parameters (RMSE=29.03, R=0.76), instability indices and meteorological parameters (RMSE=28.13, R=0.76) were better than those obtained for AQI predicted by meteorological parameters (RMSE=20.81, R=0.50) and instability indices and meteorological parameters (RMSE=19.23, R=0.47). In general, the predicted values of PM10 and CO were better compared to AQI. It can be concluded that artificial neural network couldn’t load the model properly for AQI compared to PM10.",

volume = {6},

abstract ={Aims: Nowadays, dangerous chemical pollutants by a numerous of natural and synthetic sources are produced and released to the environment. These pollutants have short-term and long-term effects on human health. The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of climate parameters and instability indices on air pollution in Tehran-Iran.  Materials and Methods: To evaluate the impact of meteorological parameters and indices of stability and instability on sensitivity analysis in Tehran-Iran, the Sharif University monitoring station was selected for air sampling and analysis. Sampling was performed from March 2011 to July 2012 in Tehran.  Findings: Results of sensitivity analysis showed that average daily change of the concentration of pollutants throughout the year was very different and intensively influenced by meteorological parameters. Results showed that wind direction (WD) (82%) and relative humidity (32%) and temperature (20%) have the most influence on the concentration values of pollutants carbon monoxide (CO), particulate matter (PM10), and air quality index (AQI). The highest concentrations of CO occurred in summer and lowest in winter, and maximum concentration of PM10 was in autumn, and its lowest concentration was in spring. Results revealed that the lowest average of AQI occurred in the spring, while in autumn, winter, and summer have almost equal values, but in winter AQI has slightly higher values.  Conclusion: According to the results of this research in Sharif station Tehran, the WD has the highest impact percentage (82%) on the concentration of pollutants. The highest concentrations of CO occurred in summer, and maximum concentration of PM10 was in autumn. },
